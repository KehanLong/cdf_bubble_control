## ðŸš€ Quick Start
Clone the repository: 

```
git clone 
cd 
```

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies
This code has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. To set up the environment:

```
conda create -n environment.yaml
conda activate arm_cdf_planning
```

You can install miniconda from [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). 

## 2D Examples
Run the file: 
```
2Dexamples/main_planning.py
```


#### ðŸ§  Neural Truncated CDF Training

*   Default training dataset is saved in training_data/


To train the neural T-CDF, run the file:
```
main_cdf.py
```
The training parameters can be adjusted in training/config_3D.py.
